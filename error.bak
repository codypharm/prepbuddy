was researching "It basically develops a study plan, but I want it to be more interactive, thus hand-holding the user through different topics, helping the user thoroughly master materials, currently it seem to just work with the materials that user provide but i also want it to allow user give it optional command to get more materials from online in order to give the user the possible best"


but came accross

To make the app more interactive and "hand-holding":

Guided learning paths: Instead of just providing a plan, the app could guide the user step-by-step through topics within their materials. This could involve:
Breaking down large topics into smaller, manageable chunks.
Providing explanations, examples, and illustrations.
Asking questions to check understanding as the user progresses.
Active recall and spaced repetition: Incorporate techniques like flashcards, quizzes, or retrieval practice exercises based on the study materials to reinforce learning and aid memory retention.
Personalized feedback and hints: Provide tailored feedback based on user responses to questions or exercises. Offer hints or explanations when a user struggles.
Progress visualization and encouragement: Show users their progress in a clear and engaging way (e.g., completion percentages, mastery levels). Offer positive reinforcement and celebrate milestones.
Interactive simulations or exercises: Depending on the subject matter, you could include interactive elements that allow users to practice concepts in a hands-on way.
To help the user thoroughly master materials:

Concept mapping or summarization tools: Allow the AI to generate concept maps or summaries of the study materials to help users see the big picture and connect ideas.
Topic-specific deep dives: Enable users to request more detailed explanations or examples on specific topics they find challenging.
Practice question generation: The AI could generate practice questions based on the study materials to test understanding.
Identification of weak areas: Analyze user performance to identify areas where they need more practice or review.
To allow users to get more materials from online:

Online content search and integration: Implement functionality that allows users to search for relevant online resources (articles, videos, tutorials, etc.) based on their study materials and topics.
AI-powered content curation: Use AI to filter and recommend the most relevant and high-quality online resources.
Integration with educational platforms: Consider integrating with popular educational platforms (like Khan Academy, Coursera, etc.) to pull in relevant course materials or videos.
Content summarization and highlighting: When pulling in online content, use AI to summarize key points or highlight important information to make it easier for the user to digest.
Additional considerations:

Different learning styles: Consider how to cater to different learning styles (visual, auditory, kinesthetic) by offering various types of content and activities.
Offline access: Ensure that essential features and downloaded materials are accessible even when offline.
Gamification: Incorporate gamification elements (points, badges, leaderboards) to make learning more engaging.
